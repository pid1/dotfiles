Dotfiles
========
My various and sundry configuration files.

Utilization
-----------
These configuration files assume particularities of my work environment, 
override default behaviors, and will likely break your system in fun and
exciting ways.

There are few desktop niceties here, as my dev environment now exists as Ubuntu
servers in various public and private clouds.

These heavily rely on my Dockerfiles. See https://github.com/pid1/dockerfiles
